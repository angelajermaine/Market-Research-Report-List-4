<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Voltage Air Circuit Breakers (ACBs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manually-operated</li><li>Electrically-operated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low Voltage Air Circuit Breakers (ACBs) come in two main types: manually operated and electrically operated. Manually operated ACBs require a person to physically switch the breaker on or off, making them suitable for smaller applications where manual control is preferred. Electrically operated ACBs, on the other hand, can be controlled remotely through an electrical signal, making them ideal for larger or more complex systems that require frequent switching. Both types offer reliable protection against overloads and short circuits in low voltage electrical systems.</p></p>
