<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hollow-carrier Perforating Guns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>WCP Type</li><li>TCP Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hollow-carrier perforating guns are commonly divided into two main types: Wireline Conveyed Perforating (WCP) Type and Tubing Conveyed Perforating (TCP) Type. WCP type guns are conveyed down the wellbore using a wireline cable, allowing for precise control and manipulation. TCP type guns are conveyed inside tubing, providing additional safety and control during the perforating process. Both types of guns are essential tools for creating holes in the well casing to increase oil and gas production.</p></p>
