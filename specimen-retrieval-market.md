<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specimen Retrieval Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detachable</li><li>Non-detachable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Specimen retrieval devices are categorized into detachable and non-detachable types. Detachable devices allow for the secure collection and removal of samples without contaminating surrounding tissue. They are often used in minimally invasive procedures such as laparoscopic surgery. Non-detachable devices, on the other hand, are designed to stay attached to the specimen during removal, providing a more secure grip. Both types serve the same purpose of safely retrieving tissue samples for analysis, but differ in their method of attachment and removal.</p></p>
