<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Roller Leveler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-roll</li><li>Multi-roll</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Roller levelers are widely used in the metal processing industry for flattening and straightening metal sheets. There are two main types of roller levelers: two-roll and multi-roll. Two-roll levelers have a simple design with two rolls that rotate to flatten the metal, making them ideal for processing thinner sheets. On the other hand, multi-roll levelers have more rolls that work together to provide more precise and uniform leveling for thicker sheets. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the metal processing application.</p></p>
