<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Structural Heart Imaging (SHI) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Echocardiogram</li><li>Angiogram</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Structural Heart Imaging (SHI) Market includes two main types of imaging techniques: Echocardiogram and Angiogram. Echocardiogram uses sound waves to create detailed images of the heart's structure and function, providing real-time information on heart valves, chambers, and blood flow. Angiogram, on the other hand, involves injecting contrast dye into the blood vessels and using x-rays to visualize any blockages or abnormalities. Both imaging techniques play a crucial role in diagnosing and guiding treatment for structural heart conditions.</p></p>
