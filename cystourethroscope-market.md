<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cystourethroscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid</li><li>Flexible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cystourethroscopes are instruments used for the visual examination of the bladder and urethra. They can be classified into two main types, rigid and flexible. Rigid cystourethroscopes are straight and inflexible, allowing for more direct visualization of the urinary tract. Flexible cystourethroscopes, on the other hand, have a bendable shaft that enables easier navigation through the twists and turns of the urinary tract. Both types have their own advantages and are used based on the specific requirements of the procedure.</p></p>
