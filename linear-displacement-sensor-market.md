<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Displacement Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Linear displacement sensors are used to measure the movement of an object along a straight line. Contact type sensors physically touch the object being measured, providing accurate and precise readings. Non-contact type sensors, on the other hand, utilize technologies such as magnetics, capacitance, or lasers to measure displacement without physical contact, making them ideal for applications where contact may not be feasible or where the object is fragile. Both types of sensors have their own unique advantages and are widely used in various industries.</p></p>
