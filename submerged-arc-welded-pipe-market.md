<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submerged Arc Welded Pipe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LSAW Pipe</li><li>SSAW Pipe</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Submerged arc welded (SAW) pipes are primarily divided into two types - Longitudinal Submerged Arc Welded (LSAW) pipe and Spiral Submerged Arc Welded (SSAW) pipe. LSAW pipes are manufactured by bending and welding steel plates longitudinally, while SSAW pipes are produced by forming a spiral shape with a constant diameter and welding the seam. LSAW pipes are commonly used in oil and gas transmission, while SSAW pipes are preferred for high-pressure water and gas pipelines due to their ability to withstand greater stresses.</p></p>
