<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Doppler LiDAR Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulse</li><li>Continuous Wave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Doppler LiDAR systems are used for measuring wind speed and direction. There are two main types of Doppler LiDAR systems in the market - Pulse and Continuous Wave. Pulse systems emit short bursts of laser pulses and measure the Doppler shift in the return signal to determine wind velocities. Continuous Wave systems emit a continuous laser beam and measure the Doppler shift in the backscattered light to calculate wind speeds. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different applications.</p></p>
