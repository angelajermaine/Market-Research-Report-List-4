<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyvinylidene Chloride (PVDC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isotactic</li><li>Atactic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) is a type of plastic resin used for packaging applications due to its exceptional barrier properties against gases and moisture. PVDC exists in different forms based on the arrangement of its molecular structure - isotactic and atactic. Isotactic PVDC has a regular and organized structure, making it more rigid and heat-resistant, while atactic PVDC has a random arrangement, leading to a more flexible and less heat-resistant material. Both isotactic and atactic PVDC offer unique properties suitable for various packaging needs.</p></p>
