<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Turn Coordinators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrically Driven</li><li>Air Driven</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Turn coordinators are crucial instruments in aircrafts for maintaining proper coordination during turns. The market for turn coordinators can be divided into two main types based on their driving mechanism: electrically driven and air driven. Electrically driven turn coordinators use electrical power to operate, offering smoother and more precise performance. On the other hand, air driven turn coordinators rely on airflow generated by the aircraft's vacuum system to operate, making them simpler and more cost-effective but may have lower accuracy compared to electrically driven ones.</p></p>
