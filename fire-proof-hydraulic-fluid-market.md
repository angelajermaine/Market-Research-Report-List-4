<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire-proof Hydraulic Fluid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HFA</li><li>HFB</li><li>HFC</li><li>HFD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire-proof hydraulic fluids are categorized into four types based on their composition and level of fire resistance: HFA, HFB, HFC, and HFD. HFA fluids are water-based and offer a low level of fire resistance. HFB fluids consist of water-in-oil emulsions and provide a higher level of fire resistance. HFC fluids are water-free and provide better fire resistance compared to HFA and HFB fluids. HFD fluids are synthetic, non-aqueous fluids with the highest level of fire resistance among the four types.</p></p>
